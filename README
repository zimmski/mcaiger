McAiger is a simple model checker based on k-induction.  The only
distinguishing feature is that by defaults it uses symbolic all-different
constraints as described in the FMCAD'08 paper:

  A. Biere, R. Brummayer.  Consistency Checking of All Different
  Constraints over Bit-Vectors within a SAT-Solver.  In Proc. 8th
  Intl. Conf. on Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design (FMCAD'08),
  IEEE 2008.

Get PicoSAT, compile it with NADC undefined, otherwise you can not use
symbolic all-different constraints ('-r' will still work though).

You also need to get a copy of the AIGER library.  Unpack it
at the same place and compile it.

Then in the same directory where you unpacked PicoSAT and AIGER, unpack
the McAiger sources and compile themwith 'make'.
